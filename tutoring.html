      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>I'm a senior undergraduate student at the University of Washington's Bothell campus double majoring in mathematics and computer science. I have over 4 years experience tutoring math, computer science, and physics from the middle school to undergraduate levels. For more on me, check out my <a href=index.html> about me</a> page.</p>

      <h2>Why Me?</h2>
      <li>I bring warmth, empathy, and positivity to any learning environment.</li>
      <li>I show students that math doesn't have to be a negative experience.</li>
      <li>I meet students where they are and find ways to connect with them.</li>
      <li>I treat students as peers because I'm a student too.</li>
      
      <h2>1-on-1 Services Offered</h2>
      <li>Test prep for <b>SAT, AP Calculus, AP Computer Science, and AP Statistics</b></li>
      <li>General math tutoring in <b>Algebra I/II, Geometry, Precalculus, Calculus...</b></li>
      <li><b>IB</b> math tutoring (SL and HL)</li>
      <li>Advanced tutoring for those who want to go above and beyond their school's curriculum</li>

      <h2>Location & Rate</h2>
      <p>I am available to tutor in the Seattle, Shoreline, Kenmore, and Bothell areas. I'm pretty flexible on scheduling, so we can definitely work out a time and meeting place that works for both of us. Sessions usually last an hour, but we can figure out a schedule that fits your needs. If you're interested, please <a href="contact.html">call or email me</a> to schedule a brief consultation. I look forward to working with you!</p>
