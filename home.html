      <p>Hi! I'm Harper, a senior undergraduate at the University of Washington's Bothell (UWB) campus majoring in mathematics and computer science.
         I am interested in category theory, complex system dynamics, and alternative computation.
      </p>

      <p>Last summer, I participated in UWB's math research experience for undergraduates, where I met lots of wonderful mathematicians and learned the joy of research. Since then, we've taken our results on the road, and I have given talks at both the <a href="https://meetings.ams.org/math/jmm2023/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/21964">Joint Math Meetings</a> and the <a href="https://nums.math.oregonstate.edu/2022"> Northwest Undergraduate Mathematical Symposium</a>, where I was awarded best talk. 
         I am currently a grader for UWB's data structures course, CSS343, and intro to proofs course, STMATH300. I also offer private <a href="tutoring.html"> tutoring</a> in math and computer science.</p>

      <p>I grew up on Bainbridge Island and have lived in the Seattle area all my life. To that end, I'm going to take a gap year before grad school to do some exploring. When not pursuing academic interests, you can usually find me cooking, playing guitar, reading, writing poetry, taking pictures, meditating, or experiencing nature.</p>
